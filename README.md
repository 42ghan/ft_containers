## STL Containers

STL Containers library provide a collection of class templates and algorithms so that programmers can easily implement comman data structures and manipulate them. The container manages its storage space by allocating and/or deallocating memory depending on how many elements are present in it. Its elements are accessed either directly or through iterators by using member functions.

There are two types of containers, sequence containers and assiciative containers. In sequence containers, data structures can be accessed sequentially. Associative containers provide sorted data structures that can be quickly searched (O(log n) complexity). There also are three container adaptors, stack (LIFO), queue (FIFO), and priority queue, that are not pure containers, but provide different interfaces of sequential containers by utilizing them in their implementations.

- Sequence containers
  - [vector](https://cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/)
  - [deque](https://cplusplus.com/reference/deque/deque/)
  - [list](https://cplusplus.com/reference/list/list/)
- Associative containers
  - [set](https://cplusplus.com/reference/set/set/)
  - [multiset](https://cplusplus.com/reference/set/multiset/)
  - [map](https://cplusplus.com/reference/map/map/)
  - [multimap](https://cplusplus.com/reference/map/multimap/)
- Container adaptors
  - [stack](https://cplusplus.com/reference/stack/stack/)
  - [queue](https://cplusplus.com/reference/queue/queue/)
  - [priority_queue](https://cplusplus.com/reference/queue/priority_queue/)

## Background Information

### Allocator

- Containers manage storage space for their elements by utilizing [`std::allocator`](https://cplusplus.com/reference/memory/allocator/) objects to dynamically allocates and deallocate memory.
- `std::allocator` is stateless. ("all instances of the given allocator are interchangeable, compare equal and can deallocate memory allocated by any other instance of the same allocator type.")
- Why use `std::allocator` instead of using `new` and `delete` directly?
  - By using `std::allocator` allocation and construction, and deallocation and destruction can be performed separately.
  - [StackOverflow discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31358804/whats-the-advantage-of-using-stdallocator-instead-of-new-in-c#:~:text=new%20and%20delete%20are%20the,then%20finally%20deallocate%20the%20memory.)
- When deallocating memory space by using `std::allocator::deallocate`, the pointer that is being deallocated must be the one allocated by `std::allocator::allocate`, and the size argument must be equal to the one used by the allocator.

### `noexcept`/`throw()`

- A lot of member functions of STL Containers' declarations are followed by `noexcept` specifier.
- It is used to let the compiler know that the function will not throw exception.
- When an exception is thrown from a **NON-THROWING** function, `std::unexpected` is called, which will terminate the program by calling `std::terminate`.
- It is used for two main reasons: [(from Modernes C++)](https://www.modernescpp.com/index.php/c-core-guidelines-the-noexcept-specifier-and-operator)
  - documents the behaviour of the function (which means the function can be safely used in a non-throwing function)
  - optimises compilation
- In C++98 standard, only the dynamic exception specification using `throw()` is available instead of `noexcept`. Since such method does not improve performance like the `noexcept` does, a question arises whether `throw()` should be utilized in this implementation [(ref. StackOverflow)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13841559/deprecated-throw-list-in-c11). However, `throw()` was used for exiting the program by calling `std::unexpected -> std::terminate` when exception is thrown from a **NON-THROWING** function was deemed more important than slight performance improvement.

### Iterators

- An iterator is an object that points to some element in a range of elements (e.g. a pointer). By using operators (at least ++ and \*), it can iterate through the elements of that range.
- Each container type has its specific iterator type.
- All iterators, regardless of their categories, are at least:
  - copy-constructible
  - copy-assignable
  - destructible
  - can be incremented using `operator++`
  - can be dereferenced using `operator\*`

#### iterator_traits

- `iterator_traits` is a class that defines properties of iterators.
- For every iterator type, at least the following member types are defined to correspond its properties.
  - `difference_type`
  - `value_type`
  - `pointer`
  - `reference`
  - `iterator_category`
- These member types are checked by STL algorithms to determine properties of the iterators passed to them and the range they represent.

#### Categories

- There exist five different categories of iterators and their hierarchy is like the diagram below.

  <img src="assets/iterator_categories.png" style="width: 80%; height: 80%; "></p>
  <figcaption align="center" style="font-weight: bold;">hierarchy between each iterator category (refer to the table in <a href="https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/iterator/">cplusplus.com</a> for further details)</figcaption>
  </figure>

- Random Access Iterator
  - access elements at an arbitrary offset position relative to the element they point to (same functionality as pointers)
  - access ranges non-sequentially
- Bidirectional Iterator
  - iterate through a range sequentially in both directions
- Forward Iterator
  - iterate through a range sequentially in one direction (beginning to end)
- Input Iterator
  - read only once, and the iterator is incremented
- Output Iterator
  - each element pointed by the iterator is written a value only once, and the iterator is incremented

### Exception Safety

- "An operation on an object is said to be exception safe if that operation leaves the object in a valid
  state when the operation is terminated by throwing an exception." (Bjarne Stroustrup, 2000)
- A set of C++ STL's exception-safety guarantees:
  - **Basic guarantee** (for all ops)
    - The basic invariants are maintained, no resources are leaked.
  - **Strong guarantee** (for key ops)
    - The object being manipulated remains in the same state as it was before the operation took place when an exception is thrown.
    - key ops e.g. : `push_back()`, `insert()`.
  - **Nothrow guarantee** (for some)
    - some ops such as destructors, `swap()`, `pop_back()` do not throw exceptions.
- "In OOP, an invariant is a set of assertions that must always hold true during the life of an object for the program to be valid." (from [StackExchange](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/32727/what-are-invariants-how-can-they-be-used-and-have-you-ever-used-it-in-your-pro), by Xavier Nodet) In the example below, `Safe` class requires successful allocation of `T`, an invariant, in order to be constructed. Therefore, `Safe` class is exception safe (basic guarantee).

```c++
template <typename T>
class Safe {
    T *p;
  public:
    Safe() : p(new T) {}
    ~Safe() { delete p; }
}
```

- It is recommended to aim for the strong exception-safety guarantee while providing the basic guarantee when writing a library. At the same time, it is better to keep templates exception-transparent (not handling all exceptions) so that the user can find the exact cause of a problem.
- Below are exception-safe implementation techniques:
  - try-block
  - [RAII](#raii)
  - do not let go of data before its replacement is stored.
  - leave objects in valid states when throwing/re-throwing an exception.

### RAII

- RAII stands for "resource acquisition is initialization." (Bjarne Stroustrup, 2000)
- RAII is a technique that "binds the life cycle of a resource that must be acquired before use (allocated heap memory, thread of execution, open socket, open file, locked mutex, disk space, database connectionâ€”anything that exists in limited supply) to the lifetime of an object." (from [cppreference.com](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/raii))
- Such technique guarantees availability (while the holder object is alive) and relief (when the object is destroyed) of resources.
- In practice, RAII: (from [cppreference.com](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/raii))
  - encapsulate each resource into a class, where
    - the constructor acquires the resource and establishes all class invariants or throws an exception if that cannot be done,
    - the destructor releases the resource and never throws exceptions;
  - always use the resource via an instance of a RAII-class that either - has automatic storage duration or temporary lifetime itself, or - has lifetime that is bounded by the lifetime of an automatic or temporary object

### SFINAE & `enable_if`

- SFINAE is an acronym for "Substitiution Is Not An Error."
- This is a rule applied to avoid a compile error when substituting the explicitly specifed or deduced type for the template parametar fails. Type deduction fails only when invalid types and expressions have been used in the immediate context of the function type and its template parameter types.
- An example of SFINAE error is when a member of a type was used where the type does not contain the member.

```C++
template<typename T>
typename T::value_type negate(const T& t) {
  retrn -T(t;)
}
// a function call to negate(42) will substitue the return type to
// `int::value_type`, and since `int` type does not have the member, `value_type`,
// SFINAE error
```

- `enable_if`, accompanied by `type_traits`, is an useful tool that differentiate template functions for different kinds of types. It can be easily implemented by using metafunctions as following code.

```C++
template <bool, typename T = void>
struct enable_if {
}

template <typename T>
struct enable_if<true, T> {
  typedef T type;
}
```

- Using `enable_if` in the template parameter as the example below only enables the declared overload for type that are input iterators. Without `enable_if` the typename `_InputIterator` does not have any semantic meaning.

```C++
template <class _InputIterator>
vector(_InputIterator __first,
       typename enable_if<__is_input_iterator<_InputIterator>::value &&
                          !__is_forward_iterator<_InputIterator>::value &&
                          ... more conditions ...
                          _InputIterator>::type __last);
```

### `is_base_of`

- `is_base_of<Base, Derived>` is a template class that is used to determine whether the `Base` type is the base class of the `Derived` class. It inherits `integral_constant` and its value is set to either true/false depending on inheritance relationship between `Base` and `Dervied`.
- In order to distinguish whether the passed argument's type to `InputIterator` parameter of `vector`'s member functions is indeed a kind of `InputIterator`, implementation of DIY `is_base_of` was tried since it is not supported in C++98 standard.
- Using the concept of [overload resolution](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/overload_resolution) (conversion to `Base *` comes before `void *`) was attempted (code below) as [is_base_of implementation on MODERNES C++](https://www.modernescpp.com/index.php/the-type-traits-library-std-is-base-of) suggests, however, without using `decltype()` keyword (C++11), the code became way too complicated.

```C++
template <typename Base>
true_type test_base_and_derived_conversion(Base *);

template <typename>
false_type test_base_and_derived_conversion(void *);

template <typename Base, typename Derived>
struct is_base_of
    : public integral_constant<bool,
                               decltype(test_base_and_derived_conversion<
                                        typename remove_cv<Base>::type>(
                                   static_cast<Derived *>(NULL)))::value> {};
```

- Therefore, using unique `is_{type of iterator}` classes was used as a filter for `InputIterator`.

### Red-Black Tree

- Red-Black Tree is a form of Binary Search Tree, which keeps the tree structure balanced

#### Insertion Cases

#### Deletion Cases

## Vector

### Features

- A vector container is an array that can change its size dynamically (using allocator object).
- It is a sequence container.
- Like arrays, data elements in a vector are stored in contiguous locations. Therefore, elements can be directly accessed, and the last element can be easily added or removed.

### Why is there `__vector_base` class?

- In STL Containers `std::vector` implementation, `vector_base` class functions as a [RAII](#raii) (exception-safety technique) wrapper.
- Aquisition of resources occur in the `vector_base` wrapper's instantiation and the resources are released when the wrapper is destroyed (after the instance of the inherited class is destroyed), so the `std::vector` instance can safely access the resources during its lifetime.

### Implementation of container specific iterator

- Each container needs its own specific iterator type that meets its special requirements. E.g. `vector`'s iterator must meet requirements of `random_access_iterator` category while `list`'s iterator must meet requirements of `bidirectional_iterator` category.
- In gcc implementation, `random_access_iterator` for the vector was implemented using `std::__normal_iterator` template class, which seems like a generic iterator template for any randomly accessible iterable objects such as `vector`, `array`, `std::string`.
- However, since only `vector` is the randomly accessible iterable object, the container's specific iterator, `VectorIterator`, has been implemented.
- `random_access_iterator` inherits characteristics of `bidirectional_iterator`. In order to support iteration in reverse way, a generic `reverse_iterator` class template was implemented.

### Member Types

```C++
typedef T value_type;
typedef typename Base_::allocator_type allocator_type;
typedef typename Base_::alloc_traits alloc_traits;
typedef typename Base_::size_type size_type;
typedef typename alloc_traits::difference_type difference_type;
typedef typename Base_::pointer pointer;
typedef typename alloc_traits::const_pointer const_pointer;
typedef typename alloc_traits::reference reference;
typedef typename alloc_traits::const_reference const_reference;
typedef VectorIterator<pointer> iterator;
typedef VectorIterator<const_pointer> const_iterator;
typedef reverse_iterator<iterator> reverse_iterator;
typedef reverse_iterator<const_iterator> const_reverse_iterator;
```

### Member Functions

#### Constructors & Destructors

```C++
// Constructors
// #1 default : empty container constructor (no elem)
explicit vector(const allocator_type& alloc = allocator_type());

// #2 fill : construct a container with n elements, fill them with val
explicit vector(size_type n, const value_type& val,
                const allocator_type& alloc = allocator_type());

// #3 range : construct a container that will contain the same values in the range [first, last)
template <typename InputIterator>
vector(InputIterator first, InputIterator last,
        const allocator_type& alloc = allocator_type());

// #4 copy constructor (keeps and uses a copy of x's alloc)
vector(const vector& x);

// Destructor
~vector(void) FT_NOEXCEPT_

```

- **Exception Safety** : strong guarantee for the constructors & non-throwing for the destructor

- **UNDEFINED BEHAVIOUR** in case inappropriate arguments have been passed to `allocator_traits::construct` for the element constructions, or the range specified by [first,last) is not valid.

- `explicit` specifier specifies that the constructors followed by the keyword cannot be used for implicit conversions and copy-initialization.

#### Iterators

```C++
// Iterators
iterator begin(void) FT_NOEXCEPT_;
const_iterator begin(void) const FT_NOEXCEPT_;
reverse_iterator rbegin(void) FT_NOEXCEPT_;
const_reverse_iterator rbegin(void) const FT_NOEXCEPT_;
iterator end(void) FT_NOEXCEPT_;
const_iterator end(void) const FT_NOEXCEPT_;
reverse_iterator rend(void) FT_NOEXCEPT_;
const_reverse_iterator rend(void) const FT_NOEXCEPT_;
```

- **Exception Safety** : non-throwing

#### Capacity

```C++
// size : returns a number of elements in the vector
size_type size(void) const FT_NOEXCEPT_;

// max_size : returns the max number of elements the vector can hold theoretically
// (depends on the system limit)
size_type max_size(void) const FT_NOEXCEPT_;

// resize : resizes the container so that it contains n elements
// If n < size(), elements beyond the first n elements are destroyed.
// If n > size(), elements(val) are inserted at the end until n == size().
// If n > capacity(), reallocation takes place.
void resize(size_type n, value_type val = value_type());

// capacity : returns the size of allocated storage capacity
size_type capacity(void) const FT_NOEXCEPT_;

// empty : returns whether the vector is empty
bool empty(void) const FT_NOEXCEPT_;

// reserve : only when n is greater than capacity(), reallocation to increase space capacity to n takes place.
void reserve(size_type n);
```

- **Exception Safety** :

  - `vector::resize`

    - `n` <= `size()`, no-throw guarantee
    - `n` > `size()` & reallocation, strong guarantee if the type of the elements is either copyable or no-throw moveable
    - else basic guarantee

  - `vector::reserve`
    - strong guarantee if no reallocations happens / the elements has either a non-throwing move constructor or a copy constructor
    - else basic guarantee.
    - `std::length_error` is thrown if n is greater than `max_size()`

#### Element Access

```C++
// Subscript & at
// returns reference of n-th element of the vector
reference operator[](size_type n) FT_NOEXCEPT_;
const_reference operator[](size_type n) const FT_NOEXCEPT_;
reference at(size_type n);
const_reference at(size_type n) const;

// front & back
// front returns the reference of the first element
// back returns the reference of the last element
reference front(void) FT_NOEXCEPT_;
const_reference front(void) const FT_NOEXCEPT_;
reference back(void) FT_NOEXCEPT_;
const_reference back(void) const FT_NOEXCEPT_;
```

- **Exception Safety** :
  - `operator[]`
    - non-throwing, if `n` >= `size()`, UB
  - `at`
    - strong guarantee
    - checks whether `n` is in range, if not throws `std::out_of_range`
  - `front` & `back`
    - non-throwing, if empty, UB

#### Modifiers

```C++
// assign : assigns new contents to the vector, destroying and replacing current contents
// modifies the vector's size iff the new vector's size() > the current vector's capacity()
// #1 range : new contents from [first, last)
template <typename InputIterator>
void assign(InputIterator first, InputIterator last);

// #2 fill : n elements, initialized to a copy of val
void assign(size_type n, const value_type& val);

// push_back : add element at the end
// reallocation takes place iff the new vector's size() > the current vector's capacity()
void push_back(const value_type& val);

// pop_back : removes the last element
void pop_back(void) FT_NOEXCEPT_;

// insert : inserts new elements before the element at the specified position
// reallocation takes place iff the new vector's size() > the current vector's capacity()
// #1 single element : insert single element, initialized to a copy of val, in front of the position
iterator insert(iterator position, const value_type& val);

// #2 fill : insert n copies of the val before position
void insert(iterator position, size_type n, const value_type& val);

// #3 range : inserts elements from [first, last) before position
template <typename InputIterator>
void insert(iterator position, InputIterator first, InputIterator last);

// erase
// #1 single element : removes a single element at the position from the vector
iterator erase(iterator position);

// #2 range : removes a range of elements([first, last)) from the vector
iterator erase(iterator first, iterator last);

// swap : swap contents with x
void swap(vector& x);

// clear : removes all elements from the vector
void clear(void) FT_NOEXCEPT_;
```

- **Exception Safety** :
  - `assign`
    - basic guarantee
    - UB in case inappropriate arguments have been passed to `allocator_traits::construct` for the element constructions, or the range specified by [first,last) is not valid.
  - `push_back`
    - if no reallocation, strong guarantee
    - else if the type of the elements is either copyable or no-throw moveable, strong guarantee
    - else, basic guarantee
    - UB if `allocator_traits::construct` is not supported with `val` as argument
  - `pop_back`
    - non-throwing, if empty, UB
  - `insert`
    - if single element at the end & no reallocation, strong guarantee
    - if reallocation takes place and the type of the elements is either copyable or no-throw moveable, strong guarantee
    - else, basic guarantee
  - `erase`
    - if the last element is also removed, non-throwing
    - else, basic guarantee
    - UB if position/range is invalid
  - `swap`
    - if the same `allocator` / allocator traits indicate that the allocators can propagate, non-throwing
    - else, UB
  - `clear`
    - non-throwing

#### `get_allocator`

## Stack

### Features

```C++
template <typename T, typename Container = vector<T> >
class stack;
```

- `stack` is a container adaptor that operates in a LIFO(Last In First Out) context. Elements are insereted and extracted via one end of the container.
- The underlying container must support:
  - `empty`
  - `size`
  - `back`
  - `push_back`
  - `pop_back`
- Among STD Containers, `vector`, `deque`, and `list` meet these requirements.
- In STD Library version, `deque` is used as the underlying container of `stack`. However, in this implementation, `ft::stack` is utilized.

### Member Types

```C++
typedef Container container_type;
typedef typename Container::value_type value_type;
typedef typename Container::size_type size_type;
typedef typename Container::reference reference;
typedef typename Container::const_reference const_reference;
```

### Member Functions

- All member functions of `stack`, except for the constructor, execute their operations by utilizing its underlying containers' member functions. Therefore, complexity and exception safety of the member funtions are the same as them of the underlying container's member functions.

```C++
// note that `c` is the underlying container object

// top : returns a reference to the top element (last-in)
reference top(void) { return c.back(); }
const_reference top(void) const { return c.back(); }

// empty : checks if the stack is empty
bool empty() const { return c.empty(); }

// size : returns the stack's size
size_type size() const { return c.size(); }

// push : adds value to the top
// pop : extracts current top element
void push(const value_type& value) { c.push_back(value); }
void pop(void) { c.pop_back(); }
```

- Constructor instantiates its underlying container. Implicit implementations of copy constructor, assignment operator overload, destructor are used.

```C++
  explicit stack(const container_type& cont = container_type()) : c(cont) {}
```

### Non-Member Functions (Relation Operators)

- Comparison of two different `stack` objects are performed by calling the same relation operator overload of the underlying container object.
- In this implementation, only `operator==` and `operator<` of the underlying container object are called. Since they are comparing the protected container object `c`, `friend` declaration of `operator==` and `operator<` are used inside the class.

```C++
template <typename T, typename Container>
bool operator==(const stack<T, Container>& lhs,
                const stack<T, Container>& rhs);

template <typename T, typename Container>
bool operator!=(const stack<T, Container>& lhs,
                const stack<T, Container>& rhs);

template <typename T, typename Container>
bool operator<(const stack<T, Container>& lhs, const stack<T, Container>& rhs);

template <typename T, typename Container>
bool operator<=(const stack<T, Container>& lhs,
                const stack<T, Container>& rhs);

template <typename T, typename Container>
bool operator>(const stack<T, Container>& lhs, const stack<T, Container>& rhs);

template <typename T, typename Container>
bool operator>=(const stack<T, Container>& lhs,
                const stack<T, Container>& rhs);
```
